Install Kafka in Ubuntu

Step 1: Installing Java (JDK)

Kafka requires Java to run. If you donâ€™t already have Java installed, you can install the OpenJDK package:

Update your package list:

sudo apt update

Install OpenJDK:

sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk -y

Verify the installation:

java -version

You should see an output displaying the Java version installed.

Step 2: Download and Extract Apache Kafka

Download the latest version of Kafka from the official website https://kafka.apache.org/downloads.
Use wget to download Kafka directly:

wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/kafka/3.9.0/kafka_2.12-3.9.0.tgz

Extract the downloaded tar file:

tar -xzf kafka_2.12-3.9.0.tgz

Move the extracted folder to /usr/local/kafka:

sudo mv kafka_2.12-3.4.0 /usr/local/kafka

Step 3: Start Zookeeper

Kafka uses Zookeeper for managing and coordinating Kafka brokers. To start Zookeeper:

cd /usr/local/kafka

Start Zookeeper using the default configuration:

sudo bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

This will start Zookeeper, and you should see logs indicating that Zookeeper has started successfully.

Step 4: Start the Kafka Server

With Zookeeper running, you can now start the Kafka broker.

Step 5: Start the Kafka broker:

Open another terminal and navigate to the Kafka directory:

cd /usr/local/kafka

sudo bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

This will start the Kafka server using the default configuration. You should see logs indicating that the Kafka server is up and running.

Step 5: Create a Kafka Topic to test installation

Open another terminal and navigate to the Kafka directory:

cd /usr/local/kafka

Create a new topic:

sudo bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

    --topic test-topic: Creates a topic named "test-topic".

Step 6: Send and Retrieve data from the Topic

Download and install kcat (former kafkacat) by:
sudo apt-get install kcat

Start kcat in producer mode
kcat -b localhost:9092 -t test-topic -P

send a test JSON and press Ctrl-D to exit input mode
{"session-id":"e24d3142-3275-4134-be8c-c4e18dba46d8","user-id":"105067","cart-id":"2af59843-596b-4a16-b8b8-d51a70a1a9a3","product-id":"","name":"ASUS ROG GTX 5090","price":"$4000"}
^D

now open kcat in consumer mode to read back the JSON read
kcat -b localhost:9092 -t test-topic -C -e

This verifies that Kafka installation is successful !!!
